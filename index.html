                    <p>We are a few passionate gamers and software developers. We are deeply enthusiastic about creating and
                        developing software applications that inspire and engage our users. We are constantly learning and experimenting with new
                        technologies and approaches, and we love to discover game play ideas that just make you keep coming back for more.
                    </p>

                    <p>Our current focus is developing 2D games for mobile, and we are hoping to release our first game in March 2024
                        on the Apple App Store. We will follow-up with a Android release shortly after the iOS release. The first game is
                        called Rocket Ripper. You can read more about this first game below.
                    </p>

                    <p>We are starting out as a family business with one full-time developer (dad) and two sons who could be considered full-time
                        gamers when their schoolwork is done. The sons have been instrumental in ideas and testing for this first game release. We hope
                        to start a youtube channel soon and begin some tutorials on Unity development. Like many indie game developers,
                        we have found Google searching and YouTube videos to be instrumental in helping us solve the problem of the day. 
                        We'd like to take some time and give back as well. Many thanks go to Unity for providing a great free-tier development 
                        environment as well!
